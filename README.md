# Manufacturing_project

Successfully executed a comprehensive data analysis project to optimize manufacturing processes and improve overall efficiency. Leveraged ETL techniques to consolidate and cleanse fragmented manufacturing data, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

Key insights and KPIs derived from the analysis included:

Manufacturing Quantity: Total units produced during a given period.
Production Quantity: Units that met quality standards and were deemed acceptable.
Wastage Quantity: Units lost due to defects, errors, or other factors.
Rejection Quantity: Units that did not meet quality standards and were rejected.
Processed Quantity: Units that underwent manufacturing processes, regardless of whether they were accepted or rejected.
Employee and Machine-wise Rejection Quantity: Analysis of rejection rates at the individual employee and machine levels to identify areas for improvement.
Production Comparison Trend: Analysis of production trends over time to identify patterns, fluctuations, and potential areas for optimization.
Manufacturing vs. Rejection Quantity: Comparison of manufacturing quantity to rejection quantity to assess overall quality and efficiency.
Department-wise Rejection Quantity: Analysis of rejection rates by department to identify departments with higher rejection rates and target areas for improvement.
By analyzing these KPIs, I was able to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for process optimization. This led to the implementation of targeted improvements, resulting in increased productivity, reduced waste, and improved overall manufacturing performance.
